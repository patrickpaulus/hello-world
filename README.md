# hello-world

Howdy, fellow coders!

I'm a numerical modeler primarily using Python. I've spent the last two years in the limbo
of thesis work and figured it could be fun to post some of the research and coursework that
comes with the territory. I'm always open to advice on stability and optimization or to fun 
collaboration.
